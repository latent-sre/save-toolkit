# Decisions and risks

The owner accepted the product direction and asked to include every discussed feature in a full
plan. The choices below are concrete proposals, not accepted architecture decisions. Decision
owners are roles to assign, not claims that a named person has approved anything.

## Decision register

| ID | Choice and recommendation | Alternatives and tradeoff | Owner and due phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEC-01 | Use Rust for the shared operations core | Python gives faster reuse; Go already fits the team stack. Rust needs new build/review expertise. Decide on distribution/reliability value, not unmeasured speed | Product owner and technical lead, P0 |
| DEC-02 | Independent product repository/release; SRE Workbench and save are working names | Keeping code here simplifies initial links but couples binary/product and prompt releases; naming/package collision checks remain | Product owner, P0 |
| DEC-03 | Start Windows x86-64 and Linux x86-64, then macOS arm64 | All platforms at once increase process/packaging test work; select OS/libc/MSRV and PowerShell support explicitly | Platform owner, P0 |
| DEC-04 | One real trading service, one Grafana origin/org and a protected read identity for pilot | Fixture-only work can prove contracts but not adoption; choose credential provider and trusted host without exposing values | Human SRE and access owner, P0 before live work |
| DEC-05 | Native Grafana reads; optional script adapters | Wrapping Python first is a useful prototype but retains interpreter dependency. Preserve helper semantics through independent/parity tests | Technical lead, P0 |
| DEC-06 | CLI and MCP share one core; local stdio first | CLI-only leaves no-terminal agents unserved; remote HTTP immediately adds identity/server operations | Host integrator, P2 |
| DEC-07 | Direct argv default; named shell tasks first | General shell source is flexible but broader and harder to constrain. Later human shell capability stays explicit | Security and operator owners, P1/P5 |
| DEC-08 | Local metadata database plus owned files, optional recording | JSON-only files simplify inspection but complicate indexing/concurrency; retention, encryption and migration need policy | Data/privacy owner, P1 |
| DEC-09 | Read existing service records with provenance | A new authoritative inventory duplicates ownership; actual record adapter/schema depends on selected team data | Service owner, P3 |
| DEC-10 | Native modules plus external process extensions | Native dynamic Rust plugins lack a stable ABI; WASM/container isolation may suit future untrusted code but adds runtime/limits work | Technical/security leads, P5 |
| DEC-11 | Durable jobs before remote execution and scheduling | Immediate distributed orchestration expands scope; decide runner transport, deployment, identity, leases and stores | Platform owner, P6 |
| DEC-12 | Evolve contracts only from concrete consumers | A generic workflow/programming language early increases attack and maintenance surface; bounded typed steps cover first use | Technical lead, each extension phase |
| DEC-13 | First live write is one named operation under separate authority | Keep all operations observational until a legitimate consumer, exact approval and recovery are demonstrated | Change owner, P7 |
| DEC-14 | Begin UI with local evidence viewer | Hosted multi-user UI requires identity, tenancy and service ownership; UI must reuse core permissions/results | Product/security owners, P8 |
| DEC-15 | Decide license, distribution, support and external product positioning before public release | Internal-first, open-source and commercial distribution have different support/licensing costs; no market-demand claim yet | Product/release owner, before distribution |

P0 decisions block implementation selection, not completion of this planning package. Later
decisions block only their dependent phases. Host/API versions and exact library pins are recorded
in implementation evidence when selected; documents do not assume today's latest will be correct
at build time.

## Risk register

| ID | Risk and consequence | Mitigation and evidence | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| RISK-01 | Wrapper adds complexity without daily benefit | Matched before/after pilot and maintenance accounting, AC-36 | Product owner |
| RISK-02 | Common command runner becomes an unintended bypass | Operation/args/config-aware grants, no automatic shell fallback, AC-02/06 | Security reviewer |
| RISK-03 | Same-account processes undermine credential isolation claims | Explicit local limitation; separately controlled runner where needed, AC-23 | Platform owner |
| RISK-04 | Grafana API/model/edition changes break semantics | Version profiles, migration research, target fixtures and live canary, AC-07/08/33 | Integration owner |
| RISK-05 | Windows quoting/process-tree behavior differs from POSIX | Real host tests, job/tree containment evidence, AC-03/05 | Platform tester |
| RISK-06 | Output or evidence exposes secrets/private telemetry | Minimal environment, bounded controlled outputs, classification/export review, AC-09/13 | Privacy/security owner |
| RISK-07 | Evidence comparison creates false conclusions | Units/coverage/identity validation, explicit incompatibility, AC-17 | SRE/domain reviewer |
| RISK-08 | Extension metadata creates authority or code execution | Reviewed immutable packages and host grants, AC-26 | Extension owner |
| RISK-09 | Crash after a write causes duplicate effects | Unknown outcome plus reconciliation/idempotency, AC-24/25 | Change owner |
| RISK-10 | Scope expands into a platform before a useful workflow exists | Complete staged scope, first product demonstration, phase gates | Product owner |
| RISK-11 | Rust expertise/dependency footprint increases maintenance | Small core, locked reviewed dependencies, documentation and ownership | Technical lead |
| RISK-12 | Agent host changes invalidate tool grants | Exact-host conformance and refresh triggers, AC-27 | Host integrator |
| RISK-13 | Local store fills, leaks or cannot downgrade | Quotas/ACLs/retention and reversible migration tests, AC-13/35 | Storage owner |
| RISK-14 | Remote scheduler replays or overlaps work | Frozen target sets, durable state, leases and injected-clock tests, AC-22/30/31 | Platform owner |
| RISK-15 | Documentation drifts from contracts | Schema examples, reference generation and release example checks, AC-35 | Documentation owner |
| RISK-16 | Product/backlog split loses decisions or duplicates work | Explicit repository handoff and single authoritative live queue | Product owner |

## Scope and authority decisions already established

The discussion requires human and agent use, common commands, Grafana, scripts, investigation
features, extensibility and future product growth. It requests full documentation and planning.
It does not select credentials, authorize production operations, install Rust, create a remote
service, publish a product, merge a branch or run a paid model campaign.

The current repository's [EFFECT-001](../fleet-roadmap.md#effect-001--effect-bound-execution-broker)
explicitly waits for a legitimate controlled-effect consumer. The future change capability is
designed here without reopening that runtime boundary. Any accepted decision replacing this
constraint must name the consumer, authority and actual execution identity.

## Review questions

The design review should settle the first consumer/service, initial platform support, credential
boundary, whether Rust's distribution benefits justify its maintenance, and who owns ongoing support.
It should inspect command execution and output/privacy failures as carefully as happy-path Grafana
reads. It should also identify which capability proves the extension contract without prematurely
requiring a marketplace or distributed control plane.
